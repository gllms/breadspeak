(title1){BREADSPEAK (FADE KASE)}

A constructed language by Jack Eisenmann

This page was generated from !{https://github.com/ostracod/breadspeak} at CURRENT_TIMESTAMP.

I started creating BreadSpeak in January 2018 as a personal conlang. I designed BreadSpeak to meet the following goals:

> Should closely follow my personal preferences
> Should contain approximately 600 words
> Should use CV syllable structure
> Should employ less ambiguous grammar than my previous languages
> Should be moderately efficient to use

BreadSpeak draws inspiration from many of my previous conlangs. BreadSpeak also includes some suggestions from external sources. The following list shows the origins of various features:

> Zese ---> Basic grammar
> Zese ---> Phonology
> Zese ---> System of word categories
> Zese ---> Etymological spelling of words
> Keru ---> System of antonyms
> Keru ---> Base dictionary definitions
> Pegakibo ---> Script
> V#{00F6}tgil ---> Lexicon size
> Conlang Critic ---> More pronouns
> Conlang Critic ---> Improved particles

(title1){PHONOLOGY AND ORTHOGRAPHY}

Every syllable consists of a single consonant followed by a single vowel. Every word consists of a chain of consecutive syllables.

BreadSpeak has ten consonants:

> (bs){k} = /k/
> (bs){g} = /g/
> (bs){s} = /s/
> (bs){z} = /z/
> (bs){t} = /t/
> (bs){d} = /d/
> (bs){f} = /f/
> (bs){v} = /v/
> (bs){p} = /p/
> (bs){b} = /b/

BreadSpeak has five vowels:

> (bs){i} = /i/
> (bs){e} = /e/
> (bs){a} = /a/
> (bs){o} = /o/
> (bs){u} = /u/

Words may be written in the Roman alphabet or BreadSpeak syllabary:

Every word containing more than one syllable belongs to a semantic category. The semantic category of a word is determined by its first syllable. The meaning of a multi-syllable word pertains in some way to its category. Examples:

> (bs){Vedo} (water), (bs){veto} (metal), and (bs){veka} (lumber) pertain to materials.
> (bs){Kasa} (talk), (bs){kabo} (word), and (bs){kapa} (know) pertain to knowledge and communication.
> (bs){Bebi} (light), (bs){bezo} (sound), and (bs){bete} (yellow) pertain to stimuli.

By altering the vowel of a category syllable, the speaker can express the antonym of a word. There are two possible vowel modifications of this kind:

> (bs){_e} (original) ---> (bs){_i} (antonym)
> (bs){_a} (original) ---> (bs){_u} (antonym)

Examples:

> (bs){Keda} (hot) ---> (bs){Kida} (cold)
> (bs){Segu} (common) ---> (bs){Sigu} (rare)
> (bs){Gagi} (good) ---> (bs){Gugi} (bad)
> (bs){Taso} (after) ---> (bs){Tuso} (before)

The speaker may perform this transformation for any multi-syllable word. However, the antonym of a word may not always be intelligible. (Ex: (bs){Fudu} = anti-potato, which probably doesn't make sense.)

(title1){GRAMMAR}

Every word has exactly one part of speech.

BreadSpeak has seven parts of speech, some of which feature different variations:

> Noun
> Descriptor
> Verb
> Preposition
> Conjunction (wide and narrow)
> Numeric
> Particle (delimiting, enclosing, and singleton)

Nouns include living things, inanimate objects, states, and concepts. Examples:

> (bs){Peka} = Person
> (bs){Dade} = Door
> (bs){Katu} = Story

Descriptors include qualities, manners, and activities. Descriptors may describe individual nouns, verbs, prepositions, or other descriptors. Descriptors encompass what would be adjectives, adverbs, articles, and intransitive verbs in English. Examples:

> (bs){Fegi} = Happy
> (bs){Tatu} = Early
> (bs){Teso} = Walk

Verbs include actions and relationships. All verbs in BreadSpeak are transitive, accepting a subject and direct object. Examples:

> (bs){Fato} = Eat
> (bs){Befe} = See
> (bs){Kako} = Signify

Prepositions include relationships and associations. Like verbs, prepositions relate two nouns together, but prepositions have different syntactic behavior. Examples:

> (bs){Pi} = In
> (bs){Tase} = Until
> (bs){Zetu} = Except

Conjunctions form lists of words or phrases. Examples:

> (bs){Ga} = And
> (bs){Go} = Or
> (bs){Gu} = Exclusive or

Numerics form explicit number values, including integer values and floating point values. Examples:

> (bs){Seta} = Two
> (bs){Seso} = Six
> (bs){Seki} = Decimal point

Particles enforce grammatical structure in sentences. Enclosing particles at the start or end of a sentence may be excluded.

(title2){PHRASE STRUCTURE}

Clauses consist of phrases. Every phrase must follow one of the structures below.

Descriptor phrase structure: (code){(descriptor phrase?) (descriptor word)}
The descriptor phrase describes the descriptor word. Examples:

(bs){Zu gake}
(code){Very important}
Very important

(bs){Teta tedo}
(code){Fast spin}
Spin quickly

Simple noun phrase structure: (code){(simple noun phrase?) (descriptor phrase?) (noun word)}
The descriptor phrase describes the noun word. The noun word is of or pertaining to the noun phrase. Examples:

(bs){Gefi zafi}
(code){Long string}
Long string

(bs){Peko fadi}
(code){Dog food}
Dog food

(bs){Zapa taza vazu}
(code){Book new store}
New book store

Noun phrase structure: (code){(simple noun phrase) (preposition phrase?)}
The simple noun phrase is involved in the relationship described by the preposition phrase. Examples:

(bs){Peke paki pevi}
(code){Cat near tree}
Cat near a tree

(bs){Faba zabo pabi bedo zavu}
(code){Coffee cup on blue table}
Coffee cup on a blue table

Simple preposition phrase structure: (code){(simple preposition phrase?) (descriptor phrase?) (preposition word)}
The descriptor phrase describes the preposition word. The preposition word is of or pertaining to the preposition phrase. Examples:

(bs){Pi di}
(code){In toward}
Into

(bs){Degi paga}
(code){Almost above}
Almost above

Preposition phrase structure: (code){(simple preposition phrase) (noun phrase?)}
The noun phrase is the object of the simple preposition phrase. Examples:

(bs){Tapi fegu}
(code){During party}
During a party

(bs){Zegi keve zepi}
(code){With nice friend}
With a nice friend

Verb phrase structure: (code){(verb phrase?) (descriptor phrase?) (verb word)}
The descriptor phrase describes the verb word. The verb word is of or pertaining to the verb phrase. Examples:

(bs){Beva kavo}
(code){Loud call}
Loudly call

(bs){Baka vapu}
(code){Hit attack}
Attack by hitting

A numeric phrase consists of a sequence of consecutive numeric words. If a numeric phrase is placed at the end of a clause, the numeric phrase behaves as a noun word. Otherwise, the numeric phrase behaves as a descriptor word. Examples:

(bs){Seto sesa}
(code){One seven}
Seventeen

(bs){Seta seki sesu}
(code){Two point five}
Two and a half

(bs){Seti dado}
(code){Four wheel}
Four wheels

A narrow conjunction only captures individual words immediately before and after. All words in a narrow conjunction phrase must have the same part of speech. A narrow conjunction phrase behaves as the same part of speech as the words it contains. Examples:

(bs){Feda gi besa daze}
(code){Angry and red face}
An angry, red face

(bs){Kesi pege gi pego pi pede}
(code){Cute sheep and pig in grass}
A cute sheep and pig in the grass (Both are cute, both are in the grass)

A wide conjunction phrase consists of a sequence of phrases separated by wide conjunction words. Each conjunction word must be the same, and each phrase must be of the same type. A wide conjunction phrase behaves as the type of phrase it contains.

(bs){Kesi pege ga pego pi pede}
(code){Cute sheep and pig in grass}
A cute sheep and a pig in the grass (The sheep is cute, but the pig is in the grass)

(bs){Dapi gezi ga bego dape}
(code){Ocean border and gray sky}
Ocean border and gray sky

A conjunction phrase may be enclosed by the particles (bs){pa} and (bs){pu}. If a wide conjunction phrase is not enclosed by these particles, it will attempt to incorporate phrases in this order:

1. Verb phrase
2. Preposition phrase
3. Simple preposition phrase
4. Noun phrase
5. Simple noun phrase
6. Descriptor phrase

Examples:

(bs){Deto zada go kepi zasu}
(code){Complete full or wet bag}
A completely full or wet bag (Not completely wet)

(bs){Deto pa zada go kepi pu zasu}
(code){Complete "pa" full or wet "pu" bag}
A completely full or wet bag (Either completely full, or completely wet)

(bs){Dapu go dafu pago zazu}
(code){River or hill in-front-of building}
A river or a hill in front of the building (The river is not in front of the building)

(bs){Pa dapu go dafu pu pago zazu}
(code){"Pa" river or hill "pu" in-front-of building}
A river or hill in front of the building (Both are in front of the building)

(title2){CLAUSE STRUCTURE}

A sentence consists of a clause punctuated by a period, exclamation mark, or question mark. Every clause must follow one of the structures below.

Verb-object clause structure: (code){(noun phrase 1?) (verb phrase) (noun phrase 2?)}
Noun phrase 1 is the subject. Noun phrase 2 is the direct object and primary object. Noun phrase 1 performs the action of the verb phrase. Noun phrase 2 receives the action of the verb phrase. Examples:

(bs){Vefa gave pepa.}
(code){Rain help plant.}
The rain helps the plant.

(bs){Gave pepa.}
(code){Help plant.}
The plant is helped.

(bs){Zaso tepa veba.}
(code){Vehicle carry sand.}
The vehicle carries sand.

(bs){Tepa veba.}
(code){Carry sand.}
The sand is carried.

Verb-preposition clause structure: (code){(noun phrase?) (verb phrase) (preposition phrase)}
The noun phrase is the subject. The first object of the preposition phrase is the primary object. The noun phrase performs the action of the verb phrase. The preposition phrase modifies the action of the verb phrase. Examples:

(bs){Vefa gave tapi fi tado.}
(code){Rain help during this season.}
The rain helps during this season.

(bs){Zaso tepa pabi zaze.}
(code){Vehicle carry on road.}
The vehicle carries on the road.

Verb-object-preposition clause structure: (code){(noun phrase 1?) (verb phrase) (noun phrase 2) "so" (preposition phrase)}
Noun phrase 1 is the subject. Noun phrase 2 is the direct object and primary object. Noun phrase 1 performs the action of the verb phrase. Noun phrase 2 receives the action of the verb phrase. The preposition phrase modifies the action of the verb phrase. Examples:

(bs){Vefa gave pepa so tapi fi tado.}
(code){Rain help plant "so" during this season.}
The rain helps the plant during this season.

(bs){Zaso tepa veba so pabi zaze.}
(code){Vehicle carry sand "so" on road.}
The vehicle carries sand on the road.

Descriptor clause structure: (code){(noun phrase?) (descriptor phrase)}
The noun phrase is the subject. The descriptor phrase describes the noun phrase. Examples:

(bs){Vefa tebo.}
(code){Rain fall.}
The rain is falling.

(bs){Zaso kebe.}
(code){Vehicle safe.}
The vehicle is safe.

Descriptor-preposition clause structure: (code){(noun phrase?) (descriptor phrase) "so" (preposition phrase)}
The noun phrase is the subject. The first object of the preposition phrase is the primary object. The descriptor phrase describes the noun phrase. The preposition phrase modifies the action of the descriptor. Examples:

(bs){Vefa tebo so tapi fi tado.}
(code){Rain fall "so" during this season.}
The rain falls during this season.

(bs){Zaso kebe so pabi zaze.}
(code){Vehicle safe "so" on road.}
The vehicle is safe on the road.

Preposition clause structure: (code){(simple noun phrase?) (preposition phrase)}
The noun phrase is the subject. The first object of the preposition phrase is the primary object. The preposition phrase modifies the noun phrase. Examples:

(bs){Vefa tapi fi tado.}
(code){Rain during this season.}
The rain is during this season.

(bs){Zaso pabi zaze.}
(code){Vehicle on road.}
The vehicle is on the road.

Noun clause structure: (code){(simple noun phrase)}
The noun phrase is the subject. The emphasis of the clause is the existence of the noun phrase. Examples:

(bs){Vefa.}
(code){Rain.}
There is rain. (It is raining.)

(bs){Zaso.}
(code){Vehicle.}
There is a vehicle.

A clause may be embedded in another clause by using specific particles. An embedded clause behaves as a noun. The meaning of this noun depends on the particles chosen. An embedded clause starts with the particle (bs){da}, (bs){fa}, or (bs){va}, and ends with the corresponding particle (bs){du}, (bs){fu}, or (bs){vu}.

If an embedded clause contains only one word, then it may be preceded by a singleton particle ((bs){do}, (bs){fo}, or (bs){vo}) instead of being surrounded by enclosing particles.
