Pegakibo ---> Script
V0tgil ---> Lexicon size
Zese ---> System of word categories
Zese ---> Etymological spelling
Keru ---> System of antonyms
Keru ---> Base dictionary definitions
Conlang Critic ---> More pronouns
Conlang Critic ---> Improved particles

Consonants:

k = /k/
g = /g/
s = /s/
z = /z/
t = /t/
d = /d/
f = /f/
v = /v/
p = /p/

Every word containing more than one syllable belongs to a semantic category. The semantic category of a word is determined by its first syllable. The meaning of a multi-syllable word pertains in some way to its category.

By altering the vowel of a category syllable, the speaker can express the antonym of a word. There are two possible vowel modifications of this kind:
_e (original) ---> _i (antonym)
_a (original) ---> _u (antonym)

Parts of speech:

> Noun
> Verb
> Descriptor
> Preposition
> Conjunction
> Numeric
> Particle

Descriptors encompass what would be adjectives, adverbs, articles, and intransitive verbs in English.

A sentence consists of a clause punctuated by a period, exclamation mark, or question mark.

Clause structure 1: [noun phrase 1?] [verb phrase] [noun phrase 2?]
Noun phrase 1 is the subject. Noun phrase 2 is the primary object.

Clause structure 2: [noun phrase?] [verb phrase] [preposition phrase]
The noun phrase is the subject. The first object of the preposition phrase is the primary object.

Clause structure 3: [noun phrase?] [descriptor phrase]
The noun phrase is the subject.

Clause structure 4: [simple noun phrase?] [preposition phrase]
The noun prase is the subject. The first object of the preposition phrase is the primary object.

Clause structure 5: [simple noun phrase]
The noun prase is the subject.

Descriptor phrase structure: [descriptor phrase?] [descriptor word]
The descriptor phrase describes the descriptor word.

Simple noun phrase structure: [simple noun phrase?] [descriptor phrase?] [noun word]
The descriptor phrase describes the noun word. The noun word is of or pertaining to the noun phrase.

Noun phrase structure: [simple noun phrase] [preposition phrase?]
The simple noun phrase is involved in the relationship described by the preposition phrase.

Simple preposition phrase: [simple preposition phrase?] [descriptor phrase?] [preposition word]
The descriptor phrase describes the preposition word. The preposition word is of or pertaining to the preposition phrase.

Preposition phrase: [simple preposition phrase] [noun phrase?]
The noun phrase is the object of the simple preposition phrase.

Verb phrase: [verb phrase?] [descriptor phrase?] [verb word]
The descriptor phrase describes the verb word. The verb word is of or pertaining to the verb phrase.

A numeric phrase consists of a sequence of consecutive numeric words. If a numeric phrase is placed before a preposition or at the end of a clause, the numeric phrase behaves as a noun word. Otherwise, the numeric phrase behaves as a descriptor word.

A conjunction phrase consists of a sequence of phrases separated by conjunction words. Each conjunction word must be the same, and each phrase must be of the same type. A conjunction phrase behaves as the type of phrase it contains.

A conjunction phrase may be enclosed by a start and end particle ("___" and "___"). If a conjunction phrase does not have these delimiters, it will incorporate the largest phrases possible in the clause.

A clause may be embedded in another clause by using specific particles. An embedded clause behaves as a noun. The meaning of this noun depends on the particles chosen.

An embedded clause is enclosed by a start particle ("___", "___", or "___") and a corresponding end particle ("___", "___", or "___"). If these delimiters are at the start or end of a sentence, they may be excluded.

If an embedded clause contains only one word, then it may be preceded by a singleton particle ("___", "___", or "___") instead of being enclosed by delimiting particles.
